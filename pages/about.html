<h1>Research Summary</h1>
<p>
  My research centers on developing efficient and interpretable machine learning
  algorithms, with a particular focus on dimensionality reduction and the
  analysis of high-dimensional data.
</p>
<p>
  I work on approaches such as manifold learning, sparse representations, and
  spectral methods to reveal underlying structure in complex datasets.
</p>
<p>
  By integrating concepts from optimization and statistical learning theory, my
  work aims to improve both the scalability and theoretical grounding of these
  algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  The ultimate goal is to design dimensionality reduction techniques that are
  robust, generalizable, and practically applicable across diverse domains,
  including bioinformatics and pattern recognition.
